        I'm a software engineer and undergraduate computer science student at
        <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/"> the University of Central Florida</a>. I
        currently work as the Development Lead at <a
          href="https://github.com/knighthacks"
          target="_blank">Knight Hacks</a
        > where I enable students to build really cool stuff with the latest tech.

        Over the summer in 2023, I also worked at <a
          href="https://discord.com/"
          target="_blank">Discord</a
        > as a Software Engineering Intern for their Design Systems team. I was a
        part of their very first intern cohort, building tools to improve designer
        workflows. You can hear more about my experience at Discord, as well as from
        other interns
