      I'm a software engineer and computer science student at the University of
      Central Florida. I currently work as the Development Lead at <a
        href="https://github.com/knighthacks"
        target="_blank">Knight Hacks</a
      > where I enable students to build really cool stuff and build products to
      support our yearly hackathon.

      Previously, I was also at <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank"
        >Discord</a
      >, where I worked as a Software Engineering Intern for their Design
      Systems team. I was part of their first intern cohort, building tools to
      improve designer workflows. You can hear more about my experience at
      Discord, as well as from other interns in <a
        href="https://discord.com/blog/what-its-like-to-be-a-discord-intern"
        target="_blank">this Discord blog post</a
