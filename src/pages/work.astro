    <p>
      I've always loved building user-facing products, and fortunately, I've
      been able to work with some awesome people to do just that. Here is a
      brief summary of the work I've done thus far.

    <WorkBlock name="Knight Hacks" context="Development Lead">
      <p>
        Knight Hacks is Central Florida's largest software engineering
        organization. I joined as a freshman in hopes of furthering myself as a
        developer, but found way more than that.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In 2022, I joined Knight Hacks' Development Team as a Front-end
          Engineer maintaining a admin dashboard built with <a
            href="https://react.dev/"
            target="_blank">React</a
          > for managing data on our hackathons. I built out several components for
          the dashboard and ensured type-safety across the code base.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2023, I stepped up as the Front-end Development Lead, where I began
          leading a small team of front-end engineers to maintain our
          user-facing products like our hackathon and club site. I also migrated
          our admin dashboard from <a
            href="https://webpack.js.org/"
            target="_blank">Webpack</a
          >
          to <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank">Vite</a>, where I saw
          decreases in build times by over 90% and bundle sizes by over 50%.
        </li>
        <li>
          Later in 2023, I was appointed to Development Lead. It was then where
          I put my focus on the developer experience of working on our products
          and moved to an entirely serverless infrastructure. I migrated our
          codebase to a monorepo built with <a
            href="https://turbo.build/repo"
            target="_blank">Turborepo</a
          > and
          <a href="https://pnpm.io/workspaces" target="_blank">
            PNPM workspaces</a
          >
          , our API from <a
            href="https://www.apollographql.com/"
            target="_blank">Apollo GraphQL</a
          > microservices to <a href="https://trpc.io/" target="_blank">tRPC</a>
          with <a href="https://hono.dev/" target="_blank">Hono</a> hosted on
          <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/" target="_blank">
            Cloudflare Workers</a
          >
          , and our database from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/"
            >PostgreSQL</a
          > to <a href="https://turso.tech/" target="_blank">Turso</a>
          with
          <a href="https://orm.drizzle.team/" target="_blank"> Drizzle ORM</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since I joined Knight Hacks in 2022, I've learned so much: from new
        technologies, to how to work with a team, and now, how to lead one.
        We've grown so much as a club, and I'm so happy to have been a part of
        such a fantastic community of open-minded and passionate engineers.

    <WorkBlock
      name="Discord"
      context="Software Engineering Intern - Design Systems"
    >
      <p>
        Discord is a communication platform designed to bring communities around
        the things they love. I joined their Design Systems team as a Software
        Engineering Intern, primarily working on tools to enhance designer
        workflows with AI. This team was filled with some of the brightest and
        most empathetic engineers and designers I've ever met. Their attention
        to detail and passion for the work do was so inspiring that I couldn't
        help but study every pull request, design review and discussion to learn
        as much as I could in the few months I was there.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at Discord, I learned so much about accessibility in
        software: concepts like <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"
          target="_blank"
          >WCAG
        </a>, <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/"
          target="_blank">WAI-ARIA</a
        >, how to build accessible web and mobile components. Of course, I also
        learned a lot about how to implement and maintain an effective design
        system, how to architect components at scale, and most importantly: how
        to efficiently perform cross functional work across various teams of
        designers, engineers, and product managers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discord was my first experience working as a software engineer at a
        company, let alone at a startup. It certainly wasn't easy. I solved some
        really hard problems, made a lot of mistakes, and learned a lot about
        from those mistakes. This experience was invaluable, and the fact that I
        was able to work with the tech I love with such a great team was
        amazing.
