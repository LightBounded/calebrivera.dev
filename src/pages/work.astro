      I've always loved building user-facing products, and fortunately, I've
      been able to work with some awesome people to do just that. Here is a
      brief summary of the work I've done thus far.

    <WorkBlock name="Knight Hacks" context="Development Lead">
      <p>
        Knight Hacks is Central Florida's largest software engineering
        organization. I joined as a freshman in hopes of furthering myself as a
        developer, but found way more than that.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In 2022, I joined Knight Hacks' Development Team as a Front-end
          Engineer maintaining a admin dashboard built with <a
            href="https://react.dev/">React</a
          > for managing data on our hackathons. I built out several components for
          the dashboard and ensured type-safety across the code base.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2023, I stepped up as the Front-end Development Lead, where I began
          leading a small team of front-end engineers to maintain our
          user-facing products like our hackathon and club site. I also migrated
          our admin dashboard from <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>
          to <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>, where I saw decreases in
          build times by over 90% and bundle sizes by over 50%.
        </li>
        <li>
          Later in 2023, I was appointed to Development Lead. It was then where
          I put my focus on the developer experience of working on our products
          and moved to an entirely serverless infrastructure. I migrated our
          codebase to a monorepo built with <a
            href="https://turbo.build/repo"
            target="_blank">Turborepo</a
          > and
          <a href="https://pnpm.io/workspaces" target="_blank">
            PNPM workspaces</a
          >
          , our API from <a
            href="https://www.apollographql.com/"
            target="_blank">Apollo GraphQL</a
          > microservices to <a href="https://trpc.io/" target="_blank">tRPC</a>
          with <a href="https://hono.dev/" target="_blank">Hono</a> hosted on
          <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/" target="_blank">
            Cloudflare Workers</a
          >
          , and our database from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/"
            >PostgreSQL</a
          > to <a href="https://turso.tech/" target="_blank">Turso</a>
          with
          <a href="https://orm.drizzle.team/"> Drizzle ORM</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since I joined Knight Hacks in 2022, I've learned so much: from new
        technologies, to how to work with a team, and now, how to lead one.
        We've grown so much as a club, and I'm so happy to have been a part of
        such a fantastic community of open-minded and passionate engineers.

    <WorkBlock
      name="Discord"
      context="Software Engineering Intern - Design Systems"
    >
      <p>
        Discord is a communication platform designed to bring communities around
        the things they love. I joined as a Summer 2023 Software Engineering
        Intern for their Design Systems team. This team was filled with some of
        the smartest engineers I've met, all from various backgrounds. I worked
        on their internal design systems, tools to improve designer workflows
        using AI, bug fixes, and documentation. It was there I learned much of
        how to work as a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at Discord, I learned so much about accessibility in
        software, things like <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"
          >WCAG
        </a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/"
          >WAI-ARIA</a
        >, how to build accessible web and mobile components. Of course, I also
        learned a lot about how to build and maintain an effective design
        system, and I think most important of all: how to perform cross
        functional work across an amazing team of designers, engineers, and
        product managers. Discord was my first taste of startup culture, and
        working remote, and I loved every second of it. I can't express how
        grateful for such a wonderful opportunity.
